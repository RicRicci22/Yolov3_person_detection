# master_degree

A repository to keep track of the work for my master degree.

STEPS:
- Set up yolov4 on colab and create a python file that do the same thing locally (to use in laboratory afterwards) 
- Process the sample video using non fine-tuned yolov4 to test benchmark performance (track also the timings). Process the video with different FPS to compare results 
- Fine tune yolov4 using VisDrone/sardCorr1 datasets and repeat the processing on the video performing the same tests to compare them
- Reproduce the results of the paper () using the fine tuned yolov4
- Perform the same steps as above but using a two-stages approach
